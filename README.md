# What's Up?
This script is intended for a Linux-based home media server to listen for CEC-messages and start a Kodi instance when TV goes on.
For more details look into the source code.

# Prerequisites
* some Linux distribution
* python3 (v3.10.12 works well)
* libCEC >= v6.0.2 with Python bindings
  * To install libCEC with Python bindings you need to execute something like the following set of commands, depending on your distribution:
    ```bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install libcec-dev
    pip3 install cec
    ```
* Kodi is set up to run as it's expected:
  * a window manager is configured to start and host Kodi
  * you'd also need to configure Kodi to exit when TV goes off

The script shall run with privileges sufficient to open COM-ports and start Kodi.

Execute this script either when TV is on and Kodi is already running or when TV is off and Kodi stopped.
