'''This script is intended for an (Ubuntu) home media server to listen for CEC-messages
and start Kodi when TV goes on.
When Kodi is up and running, it exclusively grabs CEC-adapater's COM-port,
making it unavailable for others to open and the script is simply retrying to gain
access to the adapter in a loop. After Kodi exits, the script grabs CEC-adapter
and begins waiting for any broadcast command where TV specified as the source (0)
to start Kodi upon again. The routine is supposed to run forever, the only exit trigger
is a non-zero return value of the command to start Kodi.
For the routine to work properly, Kodi shall be configured to exit after TV has been switched off,
the corresponding setting resides under the "System -> Input -> Peripherals -> CEC Adpater" preferences of Kodi.
A command to start Kodi depends on the actual setup, in my case Kodi runs as the only app in an Openbox session.
Execute this script either when TV is on and Kodi is already running or when TV is off and Kodi stopped
